# Contributing To My Vim Plugins

I'm not a Vim wizard by any means, nor am I too proud to accept
contributions that improve my code, so if you think you have a problem,
improvement, or other contribution towards the betterment of Vim-kind,
please file an issue or, where appropriate, a pull request.

When filing an issue, please explain exactly what's wrong in as much
detail as you can, and try not to insult me in doing so. "It doesn't
work, fix it" or "It doesn't work, you're an idiot" are not helpful
issues. "I try to do this, I expect this, but I get that" or "I think you
missed a step here in line 32" are better. Keep in mind that I'm not
paid to write Vim plugins, so I'm doing this in my spare time, which
means it might take me a while to respond. If you're not satisfied with
my response to your problem with my free (as in beer and in speech)
software, I will give you triple your $0.00 back.

When filing a pull request, please explain what you're changing and why.
Please limit your changes to the specific thing you're fixing; it's
probably easiest for both of us if you isolate your change in a topic
branch that I can merge without pulling in other stuff. Please do not
update CHANGELOG, versions, etc.; I'll take care of that. I'll also add
you to the Credits list with my thanks.

All of my Vim plugins use the MIT license. If you submit a pull request,
I'll assume you are OK with any code you add being placed under that
same MIT license. If this is not the case for any reason, please let me
know why you can't tolerate the MIT license. I am 99.99% likely to
reject your change in that case, but I'll let you have your say.

This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and
contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor
Covenant](contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

Thanks for contributing!
