# vim-packer

This plugin adds a `:Packer` command that runs packer, with tab
completion of subcommands.

## Installation

With [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) just do:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/hashivim/vim-packer.git

If you prefer to use something besides pathogen, go ahead.
